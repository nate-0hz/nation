# Heading

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Is this a popular note and database centred app, famous for it's black on white, clean aesthetics?

No, no, no. Ah hah. No, it definitely isn't.

This is a personal tinker project I'm using to learn Next.js, TypeScript and TailWind CSS.

It does kind of look familiar though, doesn't it?

# Heading

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Is this a popular note and database centred app, famous for it's black on white, clean aesthetics?

No, no, no. Ah hah. No, it definitely isn't.

This is a personal tinker project I'm using to expand React knowledge, and to learn Next.js, TypeScript and TailWind CSS. It is a work in progress and is in active development.

## Inspiration

Initial inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OaDyjB9Ib8, and I have plans to customise, once I have furthered my skills.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js v 14
- TypeScript
- React, including Server Components
- TailWind CSS
- Convex, for, backend and DB
- Clerk, for authentication
- Shadcn/ui component library

## Reminders for me:

- Convex:
npx convex dev

- next.js server:
npx run dev
